# Summary

By now you should have some understanding of:

- Some of Go's syntax around
    - Writing tests
    - Declaring functions, with arguments and return types
    - `if`, `const` and `switch`
    - Declaring variables and constants
- The TDD process and why the steps are important
    - Write a failing test and see it fail so we know we have written a relevant test for our requirements and seen that it produces an easy to understand description of the failure
    - Writing the smallest amount of code to make it pass so we know we have working software
    - Then refactor, backed with the safety of our tests to ensure we have well-crafted code that is easy to work with
