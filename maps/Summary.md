We made a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) API for our dictionary. Throughout the process we learned how to:
- Create maps
- Search for items in maps
- Add new items to maps
- Update items in maps
- Delete items from a map
- Learned more about errors
    - How to create errors that are constants
    - Writing error wrappers
