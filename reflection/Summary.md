# Summary

- Introduced some of the concepts from the reflect package.
- Used recursion to traverse arbitrary data structures.
- Did an in retrospect bad refactor but didn't get too upset about it. By working iteratively with tests it's not such a big deal.
- This only covered a small aspect of reflection. [The Go blog has an excellent post covering more details.](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection)
N- ow that you know about reflection, do your best to avoid using it.
